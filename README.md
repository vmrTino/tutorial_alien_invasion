alien, alien_invasion, bullet, ship and settings .py are all code from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, published by No Starch Press. All contents were created in practice following exercises in the book.
Personal Note: The approach to the exercise as followed in the book involved creating one stage at a time, and going back and editing the code as the project progressed, removing elements from the main running code ('alien_invasion.py') and parsing them out to seperate files as needed. A great introduction to generating screens and integrating user interactions, as well as coding perspective while developing a project.
